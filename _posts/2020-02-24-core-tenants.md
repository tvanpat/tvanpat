When my team was first formed I wanted to establish a series of guidelines on operational philosophy.
I wanted to avoid a typical mission statement as often times they become buzzword bingo and ultimately
meaningless.  So we developed a series of core tenents.  My goal was that when one of our customers
read the core tenents they understood how we would approach their problem.  Also these tenets would
guide us and we began a project.
