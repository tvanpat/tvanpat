# Welcome, Everything is Fine.

As I am working on my first data science blog post let me review the standard
data science blog post checklist.

- [x] Title the page "Hello World"
- [x] Add comic from [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/)
- [ ] A tutorial with missing steps or very outdated libraries.

I see a problem here, I am not going to get third item done.  The purpose of
this blog is to discuss some of my thoughts on data science as well as to document
my thought process on projects I am working on.  Once a project is complete it will
be shown in the portfolio section, which is not complete yet.  

Currently I am working on 3 projects.  
- Bounty_bot: A discord bot to manage list of members across different servers.
- NFL2SQL: This is Python library to download json files which contain NFL stats for games and store these in a PostgreSQL database.
- NFL2VIS: This is a data visualization written for Python Dash which will display data from the NFL2SQL database in a web based environment.

Each one of these presents a different challenges and will require a different solution path.  
I look forward using this space to document my solution paths, what works, and what does not work.

Thanks for stopping by.
