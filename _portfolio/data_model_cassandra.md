<h2> Project Background </h2>
This project is part of the Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree.  This is the introductory project after several classes on data modeling in a traditional SQL database.  For this project the student is to take on the role of a data engineer for a startup called Sparkify which is a music streaming app similar to Spotify.  The student is required to design, build, and populate an analytical database from user logs and song data files.  

The GitHub for this project is located here: [PostgreSQL-Data-Modeling](https://github.com/tvanpat/data-modeling-with-apache-cassandra)
