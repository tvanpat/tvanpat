<h2> Project Background </h2>
This project is part of the Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree.  This is the introductary project after several classes on data modeling in a traditional SQL database.  For this project the student is to take on the role of a data engineer for a startup called Sparkify which is a music streaming app similar to Spotify.  The student is required to design, build, and populate an analytical database from user logs and song data files.  

<h2> Project Datasets </h2>
There are two primary datasets for this project.  The Song Dataset is a subset of data from the [Millon Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/) and the Log Dataset which is simulated log data for the "Sparkify" company.  

<h3 Song Dataset</h3>
Each song is stored in a different JSON file.  An exmaple of the data reads as

>{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": >null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", >"title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
