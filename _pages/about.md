I am currently serving as a senior data science technician in the U.S. Army.  I am
working to incorporate data science into military intelligence operations.  This
is a uniquely challenging opportunity as my team and I work not only to incorporate
data science but also work to build DevSecOps environment as well as write governance.

My current areas of emphasis is focused on natural language processing and linear
optimization.

Before my current position I served as an All Source Intelligence Technician (350F).
I have worked extensively with the Distributed Ground System-A (DCGS-A) and deployed the system as part of [Operation United Assistance](https://www.army.mil/article/141290/dcgs_a_supports_101st_global_efforts_to_contain_spread_of_ebola).  I have served
as a senior intelligence advisor in both Afghanistan and Iraq.
