I am currently serving as a senior data science technician in the U.S. Army.  I am
working to incorporate data science into military intelligence operations.  This
is a uniquely challenging opportunity as my team and I work not only to incorporate
data science but also work to build DevSecOps environment as well as write governance.

Before my current position I served as an All Source Intelligence Technician (350F).
